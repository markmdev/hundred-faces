# A hundred faces

Show it to a hundred people before you post it. A wall of one hundred faces
that react while you type. Each face is an authored profile of one specific
person (name, age, job, where they live, temperament, what they care about,
how they read), and each pause in typing (600 ms) sends the message to
TypeSafe AI's Jev with four questions per person: which of seven reactions they
have (a Choice, answered with a probability distribution over the options), and
whether they understand it, trust it, and would share it (three Nouls; a Noul
is a yes/no question answered with a probability). The reactions are Jev's
estimates of how each written person would take the message. The face is drawn
from the whole reaction distribution, not just the winner, so a face that is
60% confused and 40% annoyed looks like that. Hover a face (tap it on a phone)
for the person and their numbers. The aggregates above the grid are computed
in code from the per-face answers: the reaction mix is the mean distribution,
and the understands, trusts, and would-share counts are the people whose
probability is above 50%.

## Deploy shape

Vercel serves the static site Vite builds into `dist/` and runs one function,
`api/react.ts`, for judging. The function and the local development server
share one Web-standard handler, `react(request)` in `server/react.ts`, which
does the validation, the limits, the judging, and the headers. `vercel.json`
names the build command and output directory and lets Vercel cancel the
function when the browser drops the request (which is what stops the Jev calls
when the box is cleared).

Judging is `GET /api/react?m=<message>`, the message URL-encoded and capped at
2,000 code points (413 beyond). A wall is answered with
`Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800`, so
Vercel's CDN serves an identical message, and every shared link, without a Jev
call; errors are `no-store`. The six presets never call Jev at all: `npm run
build` first runs `scripts/build-presets.ts`, which writes
`public/presets/<id>.json` from `test/fixtures/jev-presets.json` in the wire
shape, and the page loads a preset from there. The fixture is the source;
nothing is hand-copied, and the builder refuses a fixture the code has drifted
from.

To deploy a preview: `vercel` in the project directory (linked to
`hundred-faces`; `vercel link` if not). `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set on the
project for the preview and production environments (`vercel env ls`). Preview
deployments sit behind Vercel's deployment protection; production does not.

## Capacity and cost

One wall update is 10 Jev calls (batches of `BATCH_SIZE`, 10 personas each)
and about 74k input tokens, roughly $0.003. Under the documented key limit of
1,200 requests a minute that is 120 updates a minute across every visitor;
presets and shared links are free (static file, CDN). The Jev client used in
production does not retry a 429, so a busy key is reported at once instead of
amplified.

Abuse controls: a Vercel firewall rule on the project (not in this repo) rate
limits `/api/react` to 60 requests per minute per IP, fixed window, answered
429; the handler answers 403 to a browser request whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is
neither `same-origin` nor `none`; the message limit is 2,000 code points; the
browser judges on pause with one request in flight and the newest text queued
behind it. On a 429 (from Jev or from the firewall) the browser waits 2 s and
retries once, then shows "The wall is busy right now. Try again in a few
seconds." Nothing typed is logged: the handler logs statuses and durations.

## The share loop

The page URL carries the message (`/?m=<encoded>`); opening such a link fills
the box and judges through the same cached GET, and judging keeps the URL
current with `history.replaceState`. Once a wall is shown: "Post on X" opens an
X post with the top reaction, the understands and trusts counts, and the link;
"Save the wall as an image" draws the hundred faces with a header onto a
1200×1200 canvas, from the same geometry the SVG wall uses, and downloads
`hundred-faces.png`; "Copy link" copies the URL. `public/og.png` is the card
image for links to the page.

## Run it locally

Needs Node 24 and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment (the local server
reads it; the browser never sees it). The API server listens on loopback only,
on port 8787; `PORT` overrides it for both the server and Vite's proxy.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # builds the presets, then the API server and Vite together; open http://localhost:5173/
```

## Check it

```sh
npm run check      # typecheck + tests + build
npm test           # tests only; offline, against test/fixtures/jev-presets.json
npm run record     # re-record the fixture from the real API (after changing personas, questions, batch size, or presets)
npm run measure    # batching measurement against the real API; see log/ for the numbers
npm run probe      # movement, spread, self-consistency, and sanity probes against the real API
```

Tests use Node's built-in runner and run with no network. `test/react.test.ts`
is the contract test: the handler with a fixture-backed fake client on one
side, the browser's `fetchWall` on the other, one recorded fixture between
them, over the same Node adapter the local server uses. The fixture carries a
hash of the personas, questions, and batch size it was recorded against, and
the loader refuses a fixture whose hash no longer matches the code, so the
suite cannot pass on stale answers. `test/presets.test.ts` checks the built
presets against what the handler would answer.

## How a wall update works

1. The browser waits for a 600 ms pause in typing, then requests
   `/api/react?m=<message>`, one request in flight; text typed while it is out
   waits and goes out when it settles. Whatever lands with a newer sequence
   than the wall shows becomes the wall, success or failure; an older response
   is ignored. Clearing the box takes effect at once and aborts the request in
   flight, which is what tells the server to cancel its Jev calls. A preset is
   loaded from its recording instead.
2. The server splits the hundred personas into batches of `BATCH_SIZE`, builds
   one Jev request per batch with state `{ message, personas: [...] }` and four
   questions per persona addressed by path (`personas[3]`), and fires the
   batches in parallel. Why ten per call is measured and explained in `log/`.
3. Answers come back as probabilities, about half a second after the request
   left; the browser blends the seven reaction probabilities into mouth, brow,
   eye, and tint parameters and tweens each face there over 180 ms.
